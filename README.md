#From a PHP simpleMVC project to a Symfony project

This 2nd part of the project "GooDealMap" is the continuation of the simpleMVC version 
where another randomized team of 5 continued this to make it into a Symfony project.

We had only 1 week and a half to do it and present it in front of the school and multiple companies.
Oh ! And we learned Symfony the week before that via the quests in my WcsWildSeries repository.
